# alpine-confd
> This image is just copy from [smebberson/alpine-confd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smebberson/docker-alpine/master/alpine-confd/Dockerfile) but use latest alpine image version 3.4. why? cause in need to install nginx > 1.8.1, and I don't have a time to make a pull request. If you satisfied with the original image alpine version go a head and use it, it is more maintained than this image.
